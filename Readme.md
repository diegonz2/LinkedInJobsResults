# LinkedIn jobs results graph

This is a Python program that finds the number of posted jobs on LinkedIn (based in a customizable job search) grabs that data, writes it into a table, and creates a cool graph of the data.

## Steps

>1- Read and be sure you have all the requirements.
>
>2- Change the 'LinkedInUsername' to a username you want to use to login  LinkedIn to scrap the data (example - LinkedInUsername = "user@gmail.com")
>
>3- Put a password of the LinkedIn account in the 'secrets.py' file in the repo.
>
>4- If needed change the URL of the LinkedIn job search and put a custom job search you want (driver.get("https://www.linkedin.com/.../keywords=cloud&location=Worldwide")).
>
>5- Change the 'title_text' flag in the python main code and use the title you want.
>
>6- Download the Chrome Driver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and add the executable path to your environment variables 'PATH'
>
>7- Execute the code! ('LinkedInJobs.py').
>
>8- A 'JobsResultsGraph.html' file will be created automatically and will be opened in a Chrome Window (do not panic!).
