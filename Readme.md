# LinkedIn jobs results graph

>
>3- Put a password of the LinkedIn account in the 'secrets.py' file in the repo.
>
>4- If needed change the URL of the LinkedIn job search and put a custom job search you want (Line 30 of 'LinkedInJobs.py').
>
>5- Change the 'title_text' flag (line 75 of 'LinkedInJobs.py') and use the title you want.
>
>6- Execute the code! ('LinkedInJobs.py').
>
>7- A 'JobsResultsGraph.html' file will be created automatically and will be opened in a Chrome Window (do not panic!).
